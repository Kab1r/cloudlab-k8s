## Waiting for your Experiment to Complete Setup

Once the initial phase of experiment creation completes (disk load and node configuration), the profile's setup scripts begin the complex process of installing software according to profile parameters, so you must wait to access software resources until they complete.  The Kubernetes dashboard link will not be available immediately.  There are multiple ways to determine if the scripts have finished.
  - First, you can watch the experiment status page: the overall State will say \"booted (startup services are still running)\" to indicate that the nodes have booted up, but the setup scripts are still running.
  - Second, the Topology View will show you, for each node, the status of the startup command on each node (the startup command kicks off the setup scripts on each node).  Once the startup command has finished on each node, the overall State field will change to \"ready\".  If any of the startup scripts fail, you can mouse over the failed node in the topology viewer for the status code.
  - Third, the profile configuration scripts send emails: one to notify you that profile setup has started, and another notify you that setup has completed.
  - Finally, you can view [the profile setup script logfiles](http://{host-node-0}:7999/) as the setup scripts run.  Use the `admin` username and the automatically-generated random password `{password-adminPass}` .  This URL is available very quickly after profile setup scripts begin work.

## Kubernetes credentials and dashboard access

Once the profile's scripts have finished configuring software in your experiment, you'll be able to visit [the Kubernetes Dashboard WWW interface](https://{host-node-0}:8080/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#!/login) (approx. 10-15 minutes for the Kubernetes portion alone).

The easiest login option is to use token authentication.  (Basic auth is configured if available, for older kubernetes versions, username `admin` password `{password-adminPass}`.  You may also supply a kubeconfig file, but we don't provide one that includes a secret by default, so you would have to generate that.)

For `token` authentication: copy the token from http://{host-node-0}:7999/admin-token.txt (username `admin`, password `{password-adminPass}`) (this file is located on `node-0` in `/local/setup/admin-token.txt`).

(To provide secure dashboard access, we run a `kube-proxy` instance that listens on localhost:8888 and accepts all incoming hosts, and export that via nginx proxy listening on `{host-node-0}:8080` (but note that the proxy is restricted by path to the dashboard path only, so you cannot use this more generally).  We also create an `admin` `serviceaccount` in the `default` namespace, and that is the serviceaccount associated with the token auth option mentioned just above.)
 
Kubernetes credentials are in `~/.kube/config`, or in `/root/.kube/config`, as you'd expect.

## Changing your Kubernetes deployment

The profile's setup scripts are automatically installed on each node in `/local/repository`, and all of the Kubernetes installation is triggered from `node-0`.  The scripts execute as your uid, and keep state and downloaded files in `/local/setup/`.  The scripts write copious logfiles in that directory; so if you think there's a problem with the configuration, you could take a quick look through these logs on the `node-0` node.  The primary logfile is `/local/setup/setup-driver.log`.

Kubespray is a collection of Ansible playbooks, so you can make changes to the deployed kubernetes cluster, or even destroy and rebuild it (although you would then lose any of the post-install configuration we do in `/local/repository/setup-kubernetes-extra.sh`).  The `/local/repository/setup-kubespray.sh` script installs Ansible inside a Python 3 `virtualenv` (in `/local/setup/kubespray-virtualenv` on `node-0`).  A `virtualenv` (or `venv`) is effectively a separate part of the filesystem containing Python libraries and scripts, and a set of environment variables and paths that restrict its user to those Python libraries and scripts.  To modify your cluster's configuration in the Kubespray/Ansible way, you can run commands like these (as your uid):

1. "Enter" (or access) the `virtualenv`: `. /local/setup/kubespray-virtualenv/bin/activate`
2. Leave (or remove the environment vars from your shell session) the `virtualenv`: `deactivate`
3. Destroy your entire kubernetes cluster: `ansible-playbook -i /local/setup/inventories/emulab/inventory.ini /local/setup/kubespray/remove-node.yml -b -v --extra-vars "node=node-0,node-1,node-2"`
   (note that you would want to supply the short names of all nodes in your experiment)
4. Recreate your kubernetes cluster: `ansible-playbook -i /local/setup/inventories/emulab/inventory.ini /local/setup/kubespray/cluster.yml -b -v`

To change the Ansible and playbook configuration, you can start reading Kubespray documentation:
  - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md
  - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray
